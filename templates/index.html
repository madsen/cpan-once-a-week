<h1>The CPAN &ldquo;Once a Week, Every Week&rdquo; Contest</h1>

<p>In a <a href="http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2011/12/31/once-a-week-every-week/">blog entry</a>,
Mark Fowler resolved to <b>release a Perl distribution to the CPAN
each and every week</b>.  I decided to take him up on his challenge,
and created this website to track our progress.  It&rsquo;s fairly
obvious I&rsquo;m a coder, not a graphic designer.  Don&rsquo;t
complain about the design,
<a href="https://github.com/madsen/cpan-once-a-week">fork it on GitHub</a>
and improve it! Pull requests welcome.</p>

<p>If you have a
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#registering">PAUSE ID</a>,
then you&rsquo;re entered in the contest. All you have to do is upload
a distribution to CPAN every week, and don&rsquo;t skip any weeks. It
can be a new module, or just a new version of an existing module.
What&rsquo;s the prize?  The satisfaction of knowing you&rsquo;re
helping to make the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> the
greatest collection of open-source code on the planet.</p>

<p>This page shows the top 10 chains in all categories.  Click on the
headings to see the full lists.</p>
